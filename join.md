If you are a motivated person and interested in the research that we do in the CAPS group, consider joining us.

### Undergraduates

If you are in VTD, then consider doing a <b>CAPS</b>tone project with us.

If you are in another department, then contact Kyle about project options/ideas.

### Visitors

We are open to visitors, and you will find Moscow, Idaho to be a great location for a research visit.
