The CAPS lab has disbanded. It was a great time, and there was a lot
of productive research. The resulting publications are better tracked
on Kyle's [website](https://kyleharrington.com). Some highlights are:

- The SNT [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01105-7) in Nature Methods on quantifying neuroanatomy, where
  we introduced image-based modeling for multiscale agent-based
  neuroscience simulations.
- The Bionic Tracking [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00387), where we used eye tracking in VR to track
  cells in growing embryos in 3D over developmental time.
- The development of [sciview](sc.iview.sc) and publication of a
  corresponding [development paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11897).
- A Nature Cell Biology [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6935352/) on segmenting stem cells in the
  regenerating mouse incisor with Ophir Klein's group.
- The publication of the [scenery](https://scenery.graphics) framework
  and [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06726) for 3D visualization and VR in Kotlin.
- Stephan Daetwyler's [paper](https://dev.biologists.org/content/develop/146/6/dev173757.full.pdf) on imaging vascular development in 3D with
  lightsheet microscopy.
- [An evolutionary game theory
  paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/04/25/130583.full.pdf)
  on the escalation of strategic memory length in the Prisoner's
  Dilemma.
- Multiple works on artificial gene-regulatory networks with Sylvain
  Cussat-Blanc: [a
  review](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/artl_a_00267),
  [differentiable GRNs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05948),
  [neuromodulated learning in deep neural
  nets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03365).
- The full fun.imagej
  [framework](https://github.com/funimagej/fun.imagej) and
  [paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/5/899/4587585) 
- Louise Magbunduku's work on [eco-evolutionary
  swarms](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/isal_a_034)
  


The final paper from the group was on the *Physarum polycephalum*
experiments on microbial ecosystems available as a preprint
[here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.14.435300v1.article-metrics).

Kyle Harrington relocated to the Max Delbrueck Center in Berlin,
Germany, and you can continue to track him on his [website](https://kyleharrington.com).
