FunImageJ is a Lisp framework for scientific image processing built upon the ImageJ software ecosystem. The framework provides a natural functional-style for programming, while accounting for the performance requirements necessary in big data processing commonly encountered in biological image analysis. Includes support for ImageJ1, ImageJ2, imglib2, and numerous exclusive functions supporting processing, analysis, and visualization of images, meshes, and geometries.
